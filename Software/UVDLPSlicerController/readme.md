 ====================
This is the 3dDLPUVController project, also known as CreationWorkshop

This software allows you to create cross-sectional image slices of 3d Binary STL models. 
It also allows you to generate GCode to control a variety of 3d SLA printers via serial interfaces.
I used C# to code this project along with Visual Studio 2010


 New functionality also allows you to control Fused Filament Fabrication FFF/FDM machines such as RepRap machines, running standard gcode serial controllers. 
-Runs natively on Windows, it runs on Linux/Mac on Mono
-SLA Slicing is integrated
-FDM Slicing is done though Slic3r
-STL,3DS,AMF File support
-3d OpenGL model loader/viewer
-Basic model manipulation
-Support structures generation

future intgeration with CNC Mills and powder-bed based printers through a standard print interface.

Support for Uncia added
